# SM64BS
A Beat Saber mod that uses a modified version of [libsm64](https://github.com/ckosmic/libsm64/tree/changes) and [libsm64-unity](https://github.com/ckosmic/libsm64-unity/tree/changes) to put Mario in the game.

## Installation and Basics
1. Install SiraUtil, BSML, and the mod.
2. Place your copy of the US SM64 ROM in your Beat Saber directory and rename it to `baserom.us.z64`.
3. Once in-game, use the inputs on your VR controllers to control Mario in the menu.  If you are using SteamVR and some buttons/axes don't work, make sure to map them in SteamVR settings.
4. Click on Mario to open up the settings menu where you can change his nametag, colors, and game settings/plugins.

## Plugin Support
SM64BS uses a Counters+ style plugin system for customizing Mario's behavior in the game scene.  More on this later.
